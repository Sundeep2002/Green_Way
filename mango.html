            <h1>How To Grow Mango Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Mango Farming is that the leading fruit crop farming of Bharat and thought of to be the king of fruits.
                Besides the delicious taste, glorious flavor and engaging fragrance, it's made in nourishment A&C. The
                tree is hardy in nature and needs relatively low maintenance costs. Mango fruit is employed in the
                slightest degree stages of its development each in its immature and mature state. Raw fruits are used
                for creating chutney, pickles, and juices. The ripe fruits besides getting used for sweet are utilized
                for getting ready many merchandise like squashes, syrups, nectar, jams, and jellies. The mango kernel
                also contains 8-10 percent smart quality fat which may be used for soap and conjointly as a substitute
                for cola in confectionery. </p>

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <p>The fruit tree grows well in areas that have cool, dry climate with severe heat throughout the flowering
                and mature period. it's potential to grow mango trees at an elevation of 1200 m on top of water level in
                tropical zones. the common annual precipitation needed for mango farming is four hundred to 3600
                millimeter and therefore the temperature of the realm ought to be around twenty four to 27ËšC. Alkaline,
                chalky soil and serious soil are appropriate for mango farming. The hydrogen ion concentration of the
                soil ought to be within the vary of 5.5 to 7.5. but, the trees turn out best on well-drained sandy or
                gravel soil. </p>

            <h2>Cultivation</h2>


            <h2>Sowing</h2>
            <p>New garden institution starts with clearing of land and parturition out of main field as per the
                recommended spacing and normal planting system: </p>

                <img class="center" src="../img/mango/mango (4).jpeg" alt="Mango" width="350px">
            <h2>Spacing of Mango Plants:</h2>
            <p>A daily spacing of ten m x 10 m in sq. system of planting is suggested to accommodate one hundred grafts
                per hectare. However , the recommended spacing varies with dwarf varieties like Sindhu,Amrapali etc
                (planted at fivex 5 m) distance and in high density planting system.</p>

            <h2>Digging of pits:</h2>
            <p>Dig pits of onem x 1m x 1m size within the month of May, keeping top soil & sub soil on an individual
                basis and leave them open for solidification below sun shine.Mix the highest soil with a mix of
                regarding 20-25 kilogram well rotten FYM, 1.5 kg rock phospahate, 1 kg of tree cake, fifty g methyl
                radical insect powder carbaryl powder .The pit ought to be stuffed before the onset Of monsoon and left
                to cool down under the pre-monsoon showers before the planting IS done ( in early fifteen days). </p>

            <h2>Choice of grafts and planting: </h2>
            <p>One year old, healthy and straight grafts with good graft union ought to be selected from nursery so as
                to confirm good establishment.Avoid below or tender aged and over aged grafts to beat and minimize the
                mortality in field. Plant the chosen grafts within the center of Inferno when fastidiously removing the
                poly bag with intact root ball is to be planted in the center in such approach that graft union remains
                5 cm on top of the ground.And stake the graft with bamboo stick. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Grafts ought to be protected against stray animals.</li>
                <li>Offer staking to grafts to shield grafts from high speed winds. </li>
                <li>Aspect sprouts on root stock should be removed periodically. </li>
                <li>Flowers throughout 3 years should be nipped off. </li>
                <li>Mulch basins with dry leaves or grass to conserve the wetness and suppress weeds. </li>


            </ul>

            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p>Raising of root stock Collect contemporary stones within the season and place them in water to get rid of
                the floating ones.Wash sunken stones thoroughly, dip them in answer containing forty g every of BHC 40%
                and Fytolan in ten litres of water, for five minutes. Incorporate FYM @3.0 tonnes/1000 m2) in to the
                soil totally for getting ready beds for sowing the stones. Prepare raised bed of fifteen cm height and
                1m dimension of convenient length.Sow the treated stones during a single layer and cove them with skinny
                layer of soil and FYM mixed in 1:1 ratio. Irrigate the bed regularly. Stones germinate in 15-30 days.The
                seed-sprouts with smart girth of epicotyl region and have simply developed tender leaves are used as
                root stock for stone graft (epicotyl grafting). After crossing this stage, subsequently. the seedlings
                will be used for soft wood grafting. </p>
            <h3>Choice and Preparation of descendent: </h3>
            <p>Choose the tree of scion form of alternative for propagation. Collect healthy, 3-4 months old, matured
                shoots of 15-20 cm length that have dormant terminal or aspect buds on them. every shoot forms a scion
                stick and may be used for grafting. offer 2 downward slant cuts (4 - six cm long) on opposite sides at
                the lower finish of the scion stick with build it wedge shaped. </p>

            <h2>Grafting: </h2>
            <p>For epicotyl grafting, uproot the seed plant beside stone, from the the bed before the leaves expand and
                kill it at the peak of 8-10 cm.Make a cleft of 4-6 cm deep within the middle of the headless stem by
                giving a downward longitudinal cut. currently insert the wedge of the descendent in to the cleft of the
                foundation stock in such approach that the cambium of the scion and root stock are available good
                contact with every other.Tie the graft joint firmly with 1.5 cm wide and thirty cm long synthetic resin
                strip of one hundred gauge thickness. Plant the tied grafts in topolythene bag of 3Ocm X twenty cm size
                of three hundred gauge with evacuation holes and full of potting mixture of soil, sand and rubbish in
                2:1:1 proportion.Water the bagged grafts thoroughly.Planting in bag has got to be tired such approach
                that graft joint remains on top of the soil level within the synthetic resin bag </p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/mango/mango (2).jpeg" alt="Mango" width="350px">
            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>A rotten yard manure has to be applied once a year to the plants. Fertilization is completed in 2 doses,
                one in October once the plants are young and therefore the season for flowering would begin; the second
                dose is given when harvest the crops in the month of June or July. 3% foliar would likeed|is needed} for
                the plants wherever the land is sandy. The age of the fruit tree decides the quantity of plant food
                needd by it. Young plants require one hundred g of nitrogen, fifty g of phosphate and ten0 g of potash.
                The plants that are older than one0 years need high quantities of nutrients appreciate 1 kilogram of
                nitrogen, five hundred g of phosphoric and 1 kg of potash. the opposite necessary nutrients required for
                the mango trees are chlorine, boron, copper, iron, manganese, magnesium, zinc, sulphur and calcium.</p>

            <h2>Mango Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <p>The fruits ought to be harvested after they have obtained full size, so they develop characteristic style
                & flavor of the varlety. Fruits mature between ninety to one hundred twenty days from the fruit set.
                Criteria for deciding maturity are - Physical development of the fruit i.e misreckoning of vertical
                edge, development of beak,outgoing of shoulders(filling of the hollow at the steamed and look or pink
                blush or red colour. once one or 2 ripe fruits fall from the plant naturally. relative density of the
                fruit ranges between 1.01 and 1.02 . For this fruit samples, from numerous directions of the tree are
                taken & born into the bucket of water,the unfit fruits being indicative of the right maturity. the
                foremost satisfactory tool accustomed harvest the fruit is improved mango harvester although mango
                grafts might begin flowering within the second year when planting,crop ought to be taken solely after
                fourth or fifth year.The industrial production are often obtained in concerning seven years</p>
