            <h1>How To Grow Pineapple Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Pineapple (Ananas comosus) is one of Goa's commercial fruit crops. It originated in Brazil and later
                spread to other tropical parts of the world. Pineapple cultivation is limited to heavy rainfall and
                humid coastal regions on the Indian mainland and in mountainous areas. In Goa it is grown on an area of
                336 hectares with an annual production of 5,040 tons. Pineapples grow well in humid tropical conditions,
                both in the coastal belts and inland. The optimal temperature is 22 to 32 ° C. Can be grown up to 1100m
                above sea level when there is no frost. Optimal rainfall of 100-150cm is required, but nevertheless
                pineapples thrive in areas with high rainfall and also in dry areas with additional protective
                irrigation during the dry season. It can grow well in any type of soil except heavy loam. Sandy loam is
                ideal for pineapples.A soil 4560 cm deep with no stale bread or stones and a pH of 5.06.0 is preferred.
            </p>

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climate Conditions:</h3>
            <p>Pineapple cultivation benefits from a humid climate with plenty of rain. Pineapple should be cooked at a
                temperature between 22 and 320 degrees Celsius. While plant leaves grow best at 320 degrees Celsius,
                plant roots grow best at 290 degrees Celsius. The Pineapple plant does not grow at temperatures below
                200 degrees Celsius or above 360 degrees Celsius. The temperature difference between day and night
                should be 40 degrees Celsius. A high temperature at night, on the other hand, is not dangerous
            </p>
            <h3>Soil Conditions</h3>
            <p>The Pineapple crop is appropriate for cultivation in humid tropics. The Pineapple fruit grows nicely
                close to the ocean coast in addition to withinside the interior; goodbye the temperatures aren't
                extreme. The high-temperature degree at night time is deleterious for the increase of the plant and a
                distinction of at the least 40⁰C among day and night time temperatures is desirable. It may be grown as
                much as 1,000 meters above sea degree if the vicinity is frost-free. The rainfall requirement tiers from
                a hundred to a hundred and fifty cm. Sandy loam soils with a pH degree among 5.zero-6.zero are perfect
                for the increase of the plants. The vicinity with fertile soil having proper drainage is to be decided
                on for Pineapple cultivation. Field coaching is to be finished through clearing preceding plants and
                unfasten the soil for the early established order of the Pineapple plant.</p>

            <h2>Propagation Method for Pineapple Planting:</h2>
            <p>Pineapple is very easy to propagate vegetatively and through suckers that form in the axils of the
                leaves. Slips, which are suckers that emerge immediately beneath the fruit, are another method of
                propagation. Suckers and slips, on the other hand, must be preferred for planting because they bear
                earlier than the crown and produce larger fruits. After 3 to 20 years, pineapple plants from the crown
                bear flowers.</p>
            <p>The plant's performance is determined by its vigour, growth rate, time required to bear fruit, and the
                quality of the planting material. Aside from the type and size of plant material, there is also
                variation in the performance of Pineapple plants. When different types and sizes of planting material
                are used, it results in a low rate of plant establishment, uneven growth of the Pineapple plants, and
                uneven flotation.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, plant-wise operations will be followed, resulting in increased production costs in Pineapple.
                In a mixed planting, a few Pineapple plants flower while others mature, posing challenges to getting
                good uniform ratoon crops. As a result, it is always best to use uniform-sized monotype material. As a
                result, selecting the appropriate type and size of planting mater is critical.</p>
            <p>Larger planting material in suckers and slips results in more vigorous Pineapple plants. Slips and
                suckers weighing about 350 and 450 grammes, respectively, are ideal for higher crop yield with better
                productivity among the various types and sizes of propagules tested. In the absence of slips, suckers
                weighing around 500 grammes are ideal for planting. In the absence of suckers, slips are used..</p>

            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p>Pineapples are grown along coastlines and in areas with high rainfall. As a result, irrigation is
                unnecessary. However, when grown on a commercial scale, supplemental irrigation aids in the production
                of large fruits. Irrigation also aids in off-season planting. It also ensures Pineapple production all
                year. This method is used to produce high-quality pineapple fruits for export.

                Although the pineapple crop is primarily rain-fed, it is heavily irrigated. Drip irrigation is used
                successfully in areas where water supply is limited, labour costs are high, and cultivation methods are
                advanced.
            </p>


            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Dry leaves or straw is used as mulching cloth in Pineapple. Also, mulching with black polythene and
                sawdust is effective. The maturing culmination may be included with rice straw or Pineapple leaves to
                lessen each sunburn and harm resulting from the birds. Regular fertilization can do wonders for a
                Pineapple. Nitrogen is a important constructing block for younger Pineapple plant life. And, a dry
                fertilizer that has 6 to 10% nitrogen, 6 to 10% potash, 6 to 10% phosphoric acid, and four to 6%
                magnesium works well. Young plant life have to be fertilized each 2 months or so at some point of the
                developing season. Pineapple plant life require heavy manuring. Application of approximately 20 to
                30tonnes/hectare of cow dung / FYM / compost on the time of planting is vital for an amazing crop yield.
                It can soak up nitrogen withinside the shape of ammonia. Ammonium Sulphate is the excellent fertilizer
                for it. It is suggested to offer fertilizers on the charge of approximately eight:four:eight g N:
                P2O5:K2O in line with plant in line with year. Nitrogen and potash have to be carried out in 6 cut up
                doses at bimonthly intervals, besides at some point of heavy rains. The
                first dose of fertilizer is given 2 months after planting and the whole phosphorus may be given on the
                time of planting. The utility of fertilizer in rain-fed regions must be accomplished while moisture is
                available. Sometimes zinc deficiency seems in Pineapple which results in a situation referred to as
                Crookneck and spraying of 0.5% zinc sulphate can save you it.

            <h2>Pineapple Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <h3>Harvest</h3>
            <p>Ratooning in high-density planting well-knownshows that the common fruit weight withinside the first and
                2d ratoon is ready 88% and 79% respectively of the plant crop. Also, the plant stand is decreased
                ensuing withinside the discount of fruit yield through 49.three and 46.2% in first and 2d ratoon
                vegetation respectively. Prolonged ratooning consequences withinside the discount of flowering plants,
                client enchantment of the fruit, fruit size, and numerous end result appropriate for canning, however
                withinside the growth of interested end result. Also, it isn't viable to save you the discount of fruit
                yield in ratoon vegetation through growing the irrigation or through better doses of nitrogenous
                fertilizers. Pineapple end result may be harvested from 18 to 24 months after planting. A moderate
                colour alternate at the bottom of the fruit suggests maturity. Harvesting is to be completed with a
                pointy knife maintaining a five to 7 cm stalk. Care should be taken and avoid mechanical injury of
                fruit. Immediately after harvesting fruit, cool to fruit at shade before packing. </p>
            <h3>Yielding</h3>
            <p>The average yield of Pineapple is 50 – 60 tonnes per hectare and
                Under HDP Pineapple yield may 80 – 100 tonnes per hectare
