            <h1>How To Grow Apple Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated
                worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia,
                where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of
                years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious
                and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian
                tradition.</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/apple/apple (2).jpeg" alt="Apple" width="350px">
            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climatic conditions – </h3>
            <p>The apple is a temperate fruit crop. However, in India the apple growing areas do not fall in temperate
                zone but the prevailing temperate climate of the region is due to the Himalayan ranges and high
                altitudes. The average summer temperature should be around 21-24oC during active growth period. Apple
                succeeds best in regions where the trees experience uninterrupted rest in winter and abundant sunshine
                for good colour development. It can be grown at an altitude of 1500- 2700 m above the sea level.
                Well-distributed rainfall of 1000-1250 mm throughout the growing season is most favourable for optimum
                growth and fruitfulness of apple trees. </p>
            <h3>Soil conditions – </h3>
            <p> Apples grow best on well-drained, loam soils having a depth of about 45 cm and a pH level of pH 5.5-6.5.
                Soils with heavy clay soil or compact subsoil are to be avoided. Soils must be well-drained. Wet soils
                lead to poor aeration and increased incidence of crown rot in Apple trees. Normally, rooting tends to be
                shallow, and wet soils will restrict development, resulting in the poor anchorage of the tree and a
                reduced area of soil from which nutrients can be extracted. Minimum rooting depth of 4 to 5 feet is
                desirable. (Trees on shallow soils will be affected by drought and by root injury during extended severe
                cold spells.) Soil pH level and fertility can be adjusted and are not major considerations; highly
                fertile soils can cause excessive tree vigor and are not desirable.</p>

            <h2>Propogation –</h2>
            <p><strong>Grafting</strong>Apples are propagated by several methods viz.; whip, tongue, cleft and roots
                grafting. Tongue and cleft grafting at 10-15 cm above the collar during February-March gives the best
                results. Usually grafting is done at the end of winter.</p>
            <p><strong>Budding</strong>Apples are mostly propagated by shield budding, which gives a high percentage of
                success. In shield budding a single bud along with a shield piece of stem is cut along with the scion
                and inserted beneath the rind of the rootstock through a 'T' shaped incision during active growth
                period. Budding is done when the buds are fully formed during summer. The optimum time of budding is
                September in Kashmir Valley, Kumaon hills of Uttaranchal, high hills of Himachal Pradesh and June in mid
                hills of Himachal Pradesh.</p>
            <p><strong>Rootstocks</strong>Most of the apple plants are grafted or budded on seedling of wild crab apple.
                The seedling rootstocks obtained from the seeds of diploid cultivars like Golden Delicious, Yellow
                Newton, Wealthy, Macintosh and Granny Smith also can be used. High density planting is done using
                dwarfing rootstocks (M9, M4, M7 and M106).</p>

            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Manures and Fertilizers in Apple Cultivation:
                Farmyard manure @ 10 kg./ year age of tree is applied along with other fertilizers. The fertilizer dose
                depends upon the fertility of soil and amount of organic manure applied to the crop. Generally,
                application of 350 g N, 175 g P2O5 and 350 g K2O per plant per year in split doses is recommended for
                fully-grown bearing trees. On some trees deficiency of zinc, boron, manganese and calcium may be
                observed which is corrected with the application of appropriate chemicals through foliage spray.</p>

            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p> Apple trees are particularly sensitive to low soil moisture. Water stress during the growing season
                reduces number and size of fruits, and increases June drop. Success of apple largely depends on uniform
                distribution of rain during the year in case of dry spells during the critical periods supplementary
                irrigation should be provided. Water stress conditions results in poor fruit set, heavy fruit drop, low
                production and poor quality. The most critical periods of water requirement are April- August and peak
                water requirement is after fruit set. Normally the orchards are irrigated immediately after manuring in
                the month of December-January. During the summer periods, the crop is irrigated at an interval of 7-10
                days. After the fruit setting stage the crop is irrigated at weekly intervals. Application of water
                during the fortnight preceding harvest markedly improves the fruit colour. Thereafter till the onset of
                dormancy, irrigation is given at an interval of 3-4 weeks.</p>

            <h2>Apple Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <h3>Harvest</h3>
            <p>Apples come to harvest from midsummer through late fall season; fruit ripens 100 to 200 days after fruit
                set depending on the tree variety. The best method to know if Apples are ready for harvest is to taste
                them; select one and try it. Also, consider fruit skin color and fruit drop. The Apple fruits mature
                within 130-150 days after the full bloom stage depending upon the variety grown. The color of the skin
                at maturity ranges from yellow-red depending on the tree variety. However, the optimum time of Apple
                harvest depends on fruit quality and the intended period of storage.</p>
            <h3>Yielding</h3>
            <p>The present crop yield of traditional Apple is only 20 metric tons per hectare, while the high-density
                Apple breed yields about 40 to 60 metric tons of Apples per hectare.</p>
