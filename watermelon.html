            <h1>How To Grow Watermelon Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Watermelon could be a seed plant species of the magnoliopsid family family and therefore the the} name of
                its edible fruit. A scrambling and trailing vine-like plant, it absolutely was originally domesticated
                in Africa. It's a extremely cultivated fruit worldwide, with quite 1,000 varieties. Wild watermelon
                seeds are found within the prehistoric Libyan web site of Uan Muhuggiag. There's also proof from seeds
                in Pharaoh of Egypt tombs of watermelon cultivation in Ancient Egypt.
            </p>

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climate Conditions:</h3>
            <p>Temperature vary of 24-27° C are thought-about optimum for the expansion of the vines. Cool nights and
                warm days are ideal for accumulation of sugars within the fruits. The seed germinates best once
                temperatures are beyond 20° C. High humidness at the time of vegetative growth renders the crop liable
                to varied fungous diseases
            </p>
            <h3>Soil Conditions</h3>
            <p>Sandy soil made in organic matter with smart voidance and pH scale vary for 6.5-7.5 is right for
                cultivation of watermelon. This crop needs a moderate heat temperature. </p>

            <h2>Cultivation</h2>
            <p>General tips for common styles of watermelon are to plant three seeds one in. deep in hills that are
                spaced four feet apart, and permitting 6 feet between rows. Sow half-dozen to eight seeds per hill,
                later dilution to 3–4 plants per hill. Sow Watermelon seeds regarding ½-inch deep. Water seeds into the
                hills when planting. </p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/watermelon/watermelon (3).jpeg" alt="Watermelon" width="350px">
            <h2>Sowing</h2>
            <h3>Direct Sowing</h3>
            <p>the best methodology to begin Watermelon seeds is direct sowing. However, for seedlings to grow, you need
                the right conditions. Wait till the soil temperature rises on top of 21°C to plant seeds. Plant
                Watermelon seeds 6 feet apart in rows that are 6 feet apart to permit Watermelon vines many area to
                grow. Water well after seed sowing, or plant before an expected rain. Add 10-10-10 plant food Associate
                in Nursingd gently work it into the soil with a rake to feed seedlings as shortly because the seed
                germinates. </p>
            <h3>Early Sowing</h3>
            <p>Watermelons may be directly seeded outdoors before conditions reach the specified levels. Lay black
                plastic over the Watermelon bed a pair of weeks before planting to heat the soil. Cut holes within the
                plastic to plant seeds regarding half-dozen feet apart in rows 6 feet apart. Sow the Watermelon seeds
                and water well. Once the soil temperature vary reaches 21°C in the remainder of the garden, take away
                black plastic to stop the soil from obtaining too hot. </p>

            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p>Because the Watermelon plant grows, irrigation is finished each week. Attention ought to be paid to water
                stress at the time of irrigation since it will cause fruit cracking. whereas irrigating, water should be
                restricted to the basis zone of the plant. Wetting of vines or different vegetative components should be
                avoided particularly throughout flowering or mature time as wetting can lead to withering away of the
                flowers, fruits, or maybe the plant as a whole. Also, wetting of the vegetative parts can lead to the
                event of fungous diseases. wetness ought to be maintained close to the roots in order that the plants
                develop a taproot system. because the fruits near maturity, irrigation frequency is reduced and it's
                stopped throughout the harvest stage. Then, this helps in developing flavor and sweetness within the
                fruit.
            </p>


            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Once fertilizing Watermelon plants, then use nitrogen-based plant food at the onset. Once the Watermelon
                plant begins flowering, however, switch to feeding the Watermelon phosphorus and metallic element-based
                fertilizer. Watermelons would like ample potassium and phosphorus for optimum melon production.
            </p>

            <h2>Watermelon Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <h3>Harvest</h3>
            <p>Harvested Watermelons. once gathering Watermelon, cut the stem by employing a sharp knife or lawn tool
                instead of propulsion the plant from the vine. Maturity indicators disagree among varieties however
                embody the bottom spot turning yellow, the plant structure opposite the fruit shrivelling, or rind
                taking over a boring and waxy appearance. Watermelons are ripe after they sound taut and hollow to
                faucet from the knuckle. The Watermelon crop can become prepared for harvesting in eighty to one hundred
                days when sowing reckoning on the range (cultivar) and season. Normally, the maturity of Watermelon are
                often judged from withering of the tendril, ground spots to yellow and thumping test, or amendment in
                belly colour. The Watermelon fruits should be separated from the vines with the assistance of a pointy
                knife. </p>
            <h3>Yielding</h3>
            <p>The Watermelon crop yield depends on several factors like variety, soil type, climate, and farm
                management practices.
