            <h1>How To Grow Papaya Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The fruit tree may be a fast-growing, short-lived, and tropical tree. Papaya belongs to the dilleniid
                dicot genusceae|papaya family|dilleniid dicot family} and botanically known as as Carica papaya. Papaya
                is one amongst the vital fruit crops of Hawaii, Malaysia, Burma, Sri Lanka, India, Queens Land, South
                Africa, and different tropical and sub-tropical countries of the world. Papaya fruit occupies 2.0 p.c
                total fruit crop space and 5.3 percent of total fruit production in India. The plant’s fruits might war
                a range of shapes, together with pear-like or round, and are noted for his or her sweet, yellow or
                orange flesh.
            </p>

            <img class="center" src="../img/papaya/papaya (1).jpeg" alt="Papaya" width="350px">

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <p>Papaya may be a tropical, plant, sensitive to frost. Optimum temperature vary is twenty five – 30°C and
                minimum 16°C. the acceptable pH scale worth for papaya is between half-dozen and 6.5. The well-drained
                or sandy dirt soil with adequate organic matter is vital for the papaya cultivation. In high
                precipitation area, if drain is poor and roots are incessantly drenched for twenty-four to forty eight
                hours, it will cause the death of the plants. Sticky and chalky soils aren't sensible as rain might
                accumulate within the soil even just for a number of hours. during this case, a better raised bed and
                additionally drainage ditch are recommended.

                The growing field should be irrigable and unbroken at appropriate soil wetness that is critical for the
                expansion of papaya. Continuous cropping within the same field may end up in poor growth and cause
                malady issues of papaya trees. Papaya plant doesn't just like the strong, cool, hot, dry or salty wind.
                And it's higher to grow in protected however full sunshine place.
            </p>

            <h2>Growing papaya from seed: </h2>
            <p>Propagation by seed is that the universally followed system of multiplication in papaya. tho' this
                technique does not safeguard the purity of the progeny, it's inevitable as of the absence of associatey
                commercially possible vegetative propagation technique. With the commercialisation of papaya
                cultivation, the demand for quality seeds of well-established plant varieties has increased. Few tries
                are created within the past to extend effective ways of manufacturing quality seeds and maintain their
                viability. While, growing Papaya from seed is an exercise in patience, because the seeds are slow to
                germinate and need special care. within the wild, Papaya trees naturally grow as understory trees.
                Germinating Papaya seeds and young seedlings of pawpaw are very sensitive and even killed by direct
                sunlight. To with success grow Papaya from seed, you'll ought to offer them with some shade for the
                primary year or two. </p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/papaya/papaya (2).jpeg" alt="Papaya" width="350px">
            <h2>Sowing</h2>
            <p>The optimum temperature vary is twenty one – 27° C, and of radical emergence is nineteen – twenty nine
                °C. It takes 1 to four weeks from sowing to emerge looking on the temperature range. The contemporary
                seed is extracted from matured papaya fruits that had high initial wetness content that was dried to a
                secure moisture content of concerning 8% by spreading on out-of-door trays. The seed germination check
                was administrated in double chamber seed germination. For alternate temperatures, the lower temperature
                was maintained for sixteen hours and a better temperature vary for eight hours every day. </p>


            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p>Papaya is commercially propagated by seed and by tissue culture plants. The seed rate is 250 to three
                hundred grams/ha. The seedlings may be raised in nursery beds 3meters long, onemeter wide and ten cm.
                high furthermore as in pots or in polyethylene bags. The papaya seeds when being treated with 0.1%
                Monosan (phenylmercuric acetate), and ceresan, and so on are seeded 1 cm. deep in rows 10 centimeters
                apart and lined with fine compost or leaf mould. the sunshine irrigation system is provided throughout
                the morning hours. The nursery beds are covered with polythene sheets to safeguard the seedlings.
                concerning fifteen to twenty cm. tall seedlings are chosen for planting in concerning two months. </p>


            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Papaya plants would like loads of fertilizing. they're significantly greedy for gas and fertilize them
                regularly. you'll use an entire fertilizer, or like chicken manure. Papaya plants handle robust or
                contemporary manures fairly well. you must be generous with compost, and simply keep spile on the mulch
                because the plants grow bigger. .</p>

            <h2>Papaya Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <h3>Harvest</h3>
            <p>The papaya fruits are ripe for gather once the information have yellowed. once this time, it takes
                another five to seven days till they're totally ripened. Papaya fruits picked whereas still
                inexperienced can ne'er attain their full aroma. The papaya fruits are often simply plucked from the
                branches by twisting them and pushing upwards slightly. If the papaya fruits can't be reached from the
                bottom and by hand, then special baskets mounted to long poles will do the trick, whereby the fruits are
                allowed to comprise a assembling net. The stem on the fruit should be a minimum of 1 cm long in order
                that it's not damaged. every individual fruit should be hold on during a box while not it touching
                either alternative fruits or the walls of the box. this may be achieved by victimisation wood-wool. The
                fruits ought to be aerated to stop plant life inflicting mould. totally ripe fruits are extraordinarily
                liable to bruising and might be stored for many days. At one0 to 13°C, they will be stored for up to
                three weeks. </p>
            <h3>Yielding</h3>
            <p>The economic lifetime of papaya plant is barely 3 to four years. The yield varies wide according to
                variety, soil, climate and management of the garden. The yield of 75-100 tonnes /ha. is obtained during
                a season from a papaya orchard counting on spacing and cultural practices.</p>
