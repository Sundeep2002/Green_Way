            <h1>How To Grow Guava Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Guava could be a tiny tree native to the tropical and semitropic regions of the world. they're thought of
                to possess been originated from the yank country|North American nation} or Central American region so
                distributed over to different elements of the world. The crop was at the start cultivated for
                subsistence kind farming, however currently it's developed into the business farming system. Like all
                the key fruits it's undertaken as a high-density farming technique for additional productivity and
                quality of fruits. In India, it is a awfully common fruit out there within the market throughout the
                year at moderate prices. </p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/guava/guava (1).jpeg" alt="Guava" width="350px">
            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <p>Guava plants will grow much in any kind of soil, however the simplest appropriate soil condition is
                well-drained clay or sandy dirt with high organic content. The pH of the soil ought to be around five to
                7. The plants can survive at an elevation of 1600 linear unit higher than ocean level. The climate for
                guava farming should be dry with distributed precipitation throughout the year. current of air speed
                isn't suitable for guava trees. Windbreaks are to be planted round the guava trees in areas wherever the
                wind velocity ranges from fifteen to twenty four kilometre per hour. The minimum precipitation ought to
                point between a thousand to 2000 metric linear unit and therefore the temperature of the world should be
                twenty three to 28˚C.

            </p>

            <h2>Propagation Techniques of Guava -</h2>
            <p>Guava plants are propagated either by seeds or by vegetative methods. The seeds are obtained from the
                ripe fruits and are seeded in raised soil beds of the nursery within the months of August or February.
                once the seed plants grow to a height of 10-15 cm they're replanted into the most area. The descendant
                of length 2.5 cm from one seedling is removed and tied to a different exposed rootstock with a
                polyethylene strip specified the buds are left uncovered. This patch budding is completed within the
                month of might or June. once propagating through vegetative elements there are 3 potentialities
                comparable to air layering, cuttings, and mound layering. one in every of the simplest strategies of
                propagation is air layering with the assistance of growth regulators. Shoots of one cm diameter are
                chosen and a hoop of length two cm is cut from the world below the bud. The top aspect of the ring is
                treated with IBA five hundred ppm solution, so it's lined with moist sphagnum moss moss; finally, it's
                wrapped with a fifteen cm wide polyethylene sheet. each the ends of the polythene are tied. this can be
                usually tired March. when 35-40 days when the roots would be visible, it is suggested to get rid of the
                air layers and plant them within the nursery for any growth. annual shoots are used for getting twenty
                to twenty five cm of the cuttings. These cuttings are swaybacked in two hundred ppm of IBA answer for
                twenty-four hours so planted into the soil beds. wet in the soil is very important for this method.
                Mound layering is additionally done for guava propagation. during this process, the mother plants
                planted at a distance of one-meter x 1 meter are headed back within the month of Gregorian calendar
                month –August with the assistance of a stub of 5-8 cm higher than the ground. once the shoots emerge
                from the stub, a hoop of the bark is removed and a mound of soil is ready specified it covers the ringed
                shoots. inside thirty to forty days the roots develop. Then, they're detached from the mother plant and
                planted in the nursery. </p>

            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>The guava plants respond well to inorganic plant foods and organic manures. The standing of soil and
                therefore the leaf structure will facilitate us verify the fertilizer demand of the plants. the overall
                fertilizer amount is applied in 3 split doses. 33% of fertilizer is applied in February, another 33% in
                might or June and the remaining in September. one m at the bottom of the trunk the specified fertilizers
                are spread. For young plants up to four years scrap or organic manure @ ten kg, 40-200 g of urea,
                100-600 g of superphosphate and 40-225 g of muriate of hydroxide are supplied. For plants of 4-7 years
                FYM @25-50 kilogram, 200-300 g of urea, 600-1000 g of superphosphate and 225- 350 grams of muriate of
                hydroxide are supplied. For plants higher than seven years age, need fifty kg of FYM, three hundred g of
                urea, a thousand g of superphosphate and four hundred g of muriate of potash. chemical element and
                element fertilizers are extremely essential to the crops for fruiting. Micronutrients comparable to
                ZnSO₄, MgSO₄, MnSO₄, CuSO₄, FeSO₄ and teepol may be sprayed to regulate the bronzing of leaves.</p>

            <h2>Guava Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <p>Plants that are full-grown through the graft bear fruit within the third year of planting and therefore
                the harvest home time is mostly throughout August or Sept for time of year crops whereas harvesting is
                finished in January or Feb for winter season crops. If a guava tree is ten years previous then the yield
                of the tree is a hundred kilogram. The yield from grafted plants in guava is 350 kg which of
                spermatophyte plants is ninety kg per tree. The yield is a smaller amount in the starting years, i.e. 2
                year old guava plant yields four or five kg. In high density planting, the yield is seventy five
                kilogram per tree. On Associate in Nursing average, it's calculable that one square measure of land
                yields twenty five tonnes of guava fruit.
