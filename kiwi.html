            <h1>How To Grow Kiwi Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Kiwi or Chinese gooseberry is grownup wide in New Zealand, Italy, USA, China, Japan, Australia, France,
                Chile, and Spain. The edible fruit has high nutritious and healthful value. It's a chic supply of B
                vitamin & C and minerals like phosphorus, atomic number 19 & calcium. Kiwi Fruits are consumed
                contemporary or combined with alternative fruits in salads and desserts. it's additionally used for the
                preparation of squash and wine. In India, Kiwi is usually grown within the middle hills of Himachal
                Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, J & K, Sikkim, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, and Kerala. </p>

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climate Condition :</h3>
            <p>Wind may be a major limiting consider establishing a edible fruit farm and growing high-quality kiwi
                fruit. Young and flowering shoots are simply damaged, and most Kiwi orchards need protection from winds.
            </p>
            <h3>Soil Condition :</h3>
            <p>The deep, chromatic loams of the Bay of lots are well-drained however would like regular nitrogen,
                phosphorus, and atomic number 19 once the vines begin cropping. Orchards are typically inseminated in
                spring and early summer with two hundred kilograms of nitrogen, fifty five kilograms of phosphorus and
                100â€“150 kilograms of potassium per hectare. </p>

            <h2>Cultivation</h2>
            <p>Steep land is contoured into terraces for planting vines. The rows are to be orientating during a
                north-south direction to avail most sunlight. Thorough preparation of the soil is important for the made
                institution of its vineyard. Preparation of pits, a mix of yard manure and filling of pits are to be
                completed by December.</p>

            <h2>Planting Kiwi:</h2>
            <p>Kiwi Plants are largely propagated vegetatively through cuttings and grafting. Kiwi Planting is typically
                exhausted the month of January. The planting ought to be done at an equivalent depth at which the plants
                were growing within the nursery. The soil ought to be firmly placed round the roots. The plants are
                cropped laborious to regarding thirty cm. to encourage vigorous growth. </p>


            <h2>Spacing of Kiwi Plants:</h2>
            <p>Kiwi Planting distance varies per selection and system of training. Usually, the T-bar and bower system
                is adopted for planting. In T-bar, a spacing of four m. from row to row and 5-6 m. from plant to plant
                is common whereas, in pergola system, a spacing of half dozen m. from row to row should be maintained.
                to confirm pollination, male plants are distributed through the orchard, with male to feminine plant
                ratios around 1:5.</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/kiwi/kiwi (4).jpeg" alt="Kiwi" width="350px" height="400px">
            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>A chemical dose of twenty kg. yard manure (the basal dose), 0.5 kg. NPK mixture containing 15% N is
                usually recommended for application each year. when five years of age, 850-900 g. N, 500-600 g. P,
                800-900 g. K and farmyard manure ought to be applied every year. Kiwi needs high Cl as a result of its
                deficiency adversely affects the expansion of shoot and roots. In contrast, excess levels of B and
                sodium are harmful. The N fertilizer should be applied in 2 equal doses, 0.5 to simple fraction in
                January-February and also the rest when fruit set in April-May. In young vascular plants, the chemical
                is mixed within the soil at intervals the fringe of the vine, and for the matured vine it's broadcast
                equally over the complete soil surface.</p>

            <h2>Kiwi Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <p>Kiwi vine starts bearing at the age of 4-5 years whereas the industrial production starts at the age of
                7-8 years. The fruits mature earlier at a lower altitude and later at high altitudes due to variation in
                temperature. massive sized berries are harvested 1st while smaller ones are allowed to extend in size.
                once harvesting, the fruits are rubbed with a rough artefact to get rid of stiff hairs found on their
                surface. arduous fruits are transported to the market. Subsequently, they lose their firmness in
                fortnight and become edible.
