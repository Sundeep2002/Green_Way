            <h1>How To Grow Musk Melon Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Muskmelon (Kharbooj) is an vital crop grown in India. Muskmelons (Cucumis melo L. Reticulatus Group) own
                a fruit rind that's netted. The muskmelon is a member of the Cucurbitaceae (cucumber) family, which
                additionally consists of cucumbers, watermelons, and honeydew, Persian, casaba, and Crenshaw melons.
            </p>

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climate Conditions:</h3>
            <p>Muskmelon plant life flourish properly below heat weather and can not tolerate frost. The most
                advantageous temperature for germination of the seed is 27-30oC. With the growth in temperature, the
                plant life entire their vegetative increase in advance. Stormy climate especially dirt typhoon in the
                course of flowering reduces fruit setting. Dry climate with clean sunshine in the course of ripening
                guarantees a excessive sugar content material, higher flavour and a excessive percent of marketable end
                result. High humidity will increase the prevalence of diseases, especially the ones affecting foliage.
                Cool nights and heat days are perfect for accumulation of sugars withinside the end result. </p>

            <h3>Soil Conditions</h3>
            <p>A properly-tired loamy soil is preferred. Lighter soils which heat up fast in spring are commonly applied
                for early yields, and in heavier soils, the vine increase can be greater and fruit adulthood can be
                delayed. Sandy river beds with alluvial substrata and subterranean moisture of river streams guide its
                increase. In fact, the lengthy faucet root machine is customized to the increase of this crop in river
                beds. The soil ought to now no longer crack in summer time season and water ought to now no longer
                stagnate. It is vital that soil ought to be fertile properly supplied with natural matter. Muskmelon is
                touchy to acidic soils. The crop can not be grown efficaciously under pH of five.five. It prefers a soil
                pH among 6.zero and 7.zero. Alkaline soils with excessive salt attention also are now no longer
                suitable.</p>

            <h2>Cultivation</h2>
            <p>Muskmelon is likewise referred to as Kharbuj, Cantaloupe, and Honeydew. Muskmelons are a heat-season
                fruit.it incorporates approximately 90% of water and 9rbohydrates. in India muskmelon, developing states
                consist of Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh. muskmelon is the fruit
                especifically regarded for its excessive water content material and muskmelon no exception. This is one
                of the many vegetation and end result that you have to eat in warm days and notably or in particular in
                summer time season days. It is one of the end result which assist you triumph over dehydration way to
                his first rate water retention capability.</p>

            <h2>Sowing</h2>
            <p>Prepare beds 4m huge for Hara Madhu and 3m for others. Sow seeds in line with hill on each facets of beds
                at a distance of 60 cm among hills. Early crop raised from seedlings grown in polythene luggage matures
                15-20 days in advance than immediately seeded crop. The polythene luggage of 15 cm x 10 cm length and
                100-gauge thickness punched at the bottom ought to be full of a combination of soil and properly-rotten
                farmyard manure in same proportions or with soil, properly-rotten farm backyard manure and silt in same
                proportions while soil is sandy. Five to 6 kg. Bags are required to elevate seedlings for an acre.The
                seed ought to be sown withinside the luggage withinside the final week of January or withinside the
                first week of February. Seedlings ought to be included from bloodless winds. The luggage ought to be
                located close to the wall going through the sun. The seeds ought to now no longer be sown deeper than
                1.five cm. After sowing, water ought to be carried out every day withinside the afternoon, ideally with
                a sprinkling can. Transplanting ought to be performed through the quit of February or through the
                primary week of March while the seedlings are 25-30 days vintage and feature proper leaves.</p>

            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p>During summer time season, irrigate the crop each week. At the time of fruit adulthood, water ought to
                accept while it's miles vital. The over-flooding of the sphere ought to be avoided. In no case, water
                ought to be allowed to are available touch with end result. Depending on soil kind and climate
                conditions </p>
            <h3>Choice and Preparation of descendent: </h3>
            <p>Choose the tree of scion form of alternative for propagation. Collect healthy, 3-4 months old, matured
                shoots of 15-20 cm length that have dormant terminal or aspect buds on them. every shoot forms a scion
                stick and may be used for grafting. offer 2 downward slant cuts (4 - six cm long) on opposite sides at
                the lower finish of the scion stick with build it wedge shaped. </p>

            <h2>Grafting: </h2>
            <p>For epicotyl grafting, uproot the seed plant beside stone, from the the bed before the leaves expand and
                kill it at the peak of 8-10 cm.Make a cleft of 4-6 cm deep within the middle of the headless stem by
                giving a downward longitudinal cut. currently insert the wedge of the descendent in to the cleft of the
                foundation stock in such approach that the cambium of the scion and root stock are available good
                contact with every other.Tie the graft joint firmly with 1.5 cm wide and thirty cm long synthetic resin
                strip of one hundred gauge thickness. Plant the tied grafts in topolythene bag of 3Ocm X twenty cm size
                of three hundred gauge with evacuation holes and full of potting mixture of soil, sand and rubbish in
                2:1:1 proportion.Water the bagged grafts thoroughly.Planting in bag has got to be tired such approach
                that graft joint remains on top of the soil level within the synthetic resin bag </p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/muskmelon/muskmelon (2).jpeg" alt="Muskmelon" width="350px">
            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Apply 10 to fifteen tonnes of farmyard manure, 50 kg of N (one hundred ten kg of Urea), 25 kg of P205(one
                hundred fifty five kg of Single Superphosphate) and 25 kg. of K20, (forty kg of Muriate of Potash) in
                line with acre to the immediately seeded crop. The farmyard manure ought to be introduced 10-15 days
                earlier than sowing. Whole P2O5 and K2O at the side of one-0.33 of N ought to be carried out in parallel
                bands forty five cm apart, and the channel ought to be organized in among the fertilizer bands, earlier
                than the sowing of seeds. The closing dose of nitrogen ought to be carried out to the vines close to the
                bottom (however now no longer touching it) and ought to be combined with the soil in the course of the
                early a part of the developing season to make certain the most early increase, early fruit set, and
                early adulthood.</p>
