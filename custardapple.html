            <h1>How To Grow Custard Apple Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Custard Apple could be a fruit from alittle deciduous, semi-evergreen plant happiness to the Annonaceae
                family. The tree is usually found in sub-tropical regions of the globe and there are concerning 2000
                plants everywhere the world that belong to the present group. dish apple is taken into account to be a
                native of the West Indies, however it's long been cultivated in South American country and Brazil. This
                tree is usually found within the state and generally it's seen growing in island and southern Florida.
                One will notice custard apple trees being cultivated in India, South Africa, some regions of South Asia,
                and also the Philippines. dish apple is self-addressed with totally different names comparable to
                wild-sweetsop, bull’s heart, bullock’s heart, or ox heart. This tree isn't terribly enticing in nature
                however bears fruits with a pleasant flavor. In India, it's called ‘Sitaphal’ and it is calculable that
                around 55 thousand hectares of land are dedicated to custard apple cultivation in India. </p>

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climatic conditions – </h3>
            <p>The plants would like a tropical climate for better performance, but should even have cooler winters.
                it's expected to grow well on the plains and conjointly on elevations up to 4000 ft. The plant will
                tolerate a temperature of twenty seven or 28˚F while not obtaining harmed. Plants would like a damp
                climate (around seventy to 80%) for survival and also the minimum annual rain needed by the plants is
                around 50-80 cm. The plants begin flowering throughout the hot, dry climate and bear fruit during the
                monsoon. </p>
            <h3>Soil conditions – </h3>
            <p> There's no explicit soil for cultivating custard apple as a result of it will flourish in any kind of
                soil like shallow, sandy, clayey loam, etcetera the best-suited soil is sandy dirt soil. The soil for
                dish apple farming ought to be well-drained just like the deep black soil. The plants are ineffective to
                saline conditions within the soil, however alkalinity, chlorine, improper drainage, or marshy-wet lands
                hamper the expansion of the plants and bearing. The subsoil should be a minimum of onem deep to
                forestall plant disease and guarantee higher performance. If the surface soil is a smaller amount than 1
                m deep, then the planting should be done on mounds. </p>

            <h2>Cultivation -</h2>
            <p>Land ought to be completely cleared and tilled before planting the seedlings. Pits of dimensions sixty x
                60 x 60 cm are created before the start of the monsoon and will be crammed with FYM, margosa cake, and
                single super phosphate. when filling the pits with the specified manure, they ought to be left open for
                fifteen days before planting. The spacing between every pit can be either of the following; four x 4 m,
                5 x 5 m, or vi x 6 m and it mostly depends on the kind of soil. it's been discovered that spacing of 6 x
                4 m with a correct drip irrigation system has provided sensible growth within the plants and increased
                the fruit-bearing. The planting is principally done throughout the monsoon. </p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/custardapple/custardapple (3).jpg" alt="Custardapple" width="350px">
            <h2>Propogation –</h2>
            <p>Seeds are unremarkably used for the propagation of custard apple plants, however there can be different
                strategies like inarching, budding, or affixation for propagating the plants. it's discovered that once
                the seeds are treated for twenty-four hours with an acceptable solution, they germinate quickly and
                uniformly. The germination takes thirty days and it can be accelerated by soaking the seeds for three
                days at area temperature. Scarification i.e. breaking the episperm mistreatment baby nail clippers can
                even be helpful for up the rate of germination. The seeds are adult rigorously associate degree
                exceedingly|in a very} nursery before being transplanted into the most farming area. The seeds shouldn't
                be planted on the far side a depth of ¾ of an inch. </p>





            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Manures and Fertilizers in Custard Apple Cultivation:
                If the dish apple plants are being rained, then no manures or fertilizers are applied. For having an
                early harvest or for making a decent quality harvest, the subsequent fertilizers can be applied to a
                very grown tree: ten kilogram of bio meal throughout planting. Ormichem substance mixture @ 0.250 kg
                during flowering and another dose of 10: 26: twenty six mixture throughout fruit set. ten g/l of 8: 12:
                24: four foliar spray is employed double during fruit set. The plant whereas bearing season wants 250 g
                of N, a hundred twenty five g of potassium, and phosphorous. because the plant attains 5 years, it ought
                to be inseminated with 450 g of N, P₂O₅, and K₂O. </p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/custardapple/custardapple (5).jpg" alt="Custardapple" width="350px">
            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p> The soil should have uniform wet content throughout the fruit set and development amount such high yield
                can be obtained and there would be no issues like fruit splitting. Irrigation is very necessary to own
                sensible quality fruit from the plant. Care ought to be taken such the salinity within the water doesn’t
                exceed 800 µS/cm. One square measure of dish apple farm might have five megaliters of water throughout
                the whole year. once the plant starts flowering, irrigation should be provided until regular monsoon
                sets in. Drip systems, flood, or mist mechanical device systems can be accustomed improve flowering and
                fruit sets. Mist sprinkler could be a extremely most well-liked irrigation technique as a result of it
                keeps the temperature low and will increase the humidity. If irrigation is provided during fruit
                development then it improves the scale and quality of the fruit.</p>

            <h2>Custard Apple Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <h3>Harvest</h3>
            <p>ACustard apple could be a seasonal fruit and will solely be harvested once it reaches complete maturity.
                The fruit maturity is thought by the amendment in color of the fruit from inexperienced to a unique
                shade. Another indication of maturity in custard apples is known by the show of inner pulp. The fruit
                should ne'er be picked when it's green in color as a result of later it might turn into inferior
                quality. The fruits are harvested in late spring or winter (August to October) and it is calculable that
                a mature tree will manufacture seventy five to a hundred pounds (34-45 kg) of fruits annually. once the
                harvest, short twigs that bore flowers and fruits are shed completely. </p>
